		<h1>ABOUT WLWCCS</h1>
                <p>
		WLWCCS Hosting is a simple-to-use, free Minecraft server hosting capable of freely letting you run your servers 24/7 with little downtime!<br>  
                While you can still turn on and turn off your WLWCCS servers, if you wish for that 24/7 functionality - just leave it on! Even if there is no longer actually on the server, it'll still continue to run!<br>
                As of right now - WLWCCS servers come in the form as either a Bedrock edition server, a Java edition server and a server that supports both editions using a plugin called Geyser.<br>
                Once you setup a server, you join by using the domain name "wlwccs.duckdns.org" in the IP address field, and then using whatever port number was displayed under the "IPv4 port" term in your server panel.<br>
                On top of that, you can also run commands remotely from the server panel. This requires that you obviously have correct syntax - and don't use a slash at the start of your command!<br>
                (unlike what you would do in game, putting a slash in front of the command invalidates it due to development choices regarding the official minecraft server software)<br>
                </p>

		<h2>How to Setup a Server</h2>
		<p>
		You'll want to first make an account.
		In the menu-bar at the top of the page, you should see a button that says "Signup". Click on that and setup an account.
		<i>NOTE: You must be at least 13 years old to make a WLWCCS account. You may read the <a href="policy.html">privacy policy</a> if you have any questions regarding this.</i>
		Now, once the signup process finishes successfully you will be taken to a screen where it'll ask you to choose between three differents options:
		<ul>
			<li>A bedrock server</li>
			<li>A java server</li>
			<li>A bedrock & java server</li>
		</ul>
		Now, which one you choose heavily depends on what you want out of the server.
		If you are playing on Bedrock edition and the other players who will be on the server also use bedrock - choose the Bedrock option. Bedrock servers are also generally smaller and faster than the other options.
		If you are playing on Java edition and the other players who will be on the server also use java - choose the Java option.
		If you have a mix of both edition players - use the Bedrock & Java option, which uses the standalone Geyser plugin. There is the downside though that Bedrock players may experience some lag or weird movement bugs.

		Once you choose your option - you should then be taken to a server panel!
		
		When you make a server it is off by default. When you want to play on your server, press the "Toggle Server" option to turn it on and off when needed!
		Underneath you'll see the port number. This is crucial for when you actually want to join the server.

		When in Minecraft trying to add and play the server - set the IP address section to <b>wlwccs.duckdns.org</b> and set the port number to whatever you saw underneath the toggle button.
		
		If you want to do anything else:
		If you want to toggle cheats on the server - there's a button just for that in the server properties section of your server panel. By default, cheats are disabled.
		If you want to toggle the default gamemode on the server - there's a button for that in the server properties section of your panel. By default, the gamemode is Survival.
		There is also a field above the server properties section which is where you would input commands. Note that <b>most commands do not work without cheats enabled.</b>
		Note that also you must <b>drop the / at the start of the command like you would in Minecraft for the command to actually work.</b>
