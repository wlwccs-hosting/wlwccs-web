		<h1>ABOUT WLWCCS</h1>
                <p class="doc-t">
		WLWCCS Hosting is a simple-to-use, free Minecraft server hosting capable of freely letting you run your servers 24/7 with little downtime!  
                While you can still turn on and turn off your WLWCCS servers, if you wish for that 24/7 functionality - just leave it on! Even if there is no longer actually on the server, it'll still continue to run!
                As of right now - WLWCCS servers come in the form as either a Bedrock edition server, a Java edition server and a server that supports both editions using a plugin called Geyser.
                Once you setup a server, you join by using the domain name "wlwccs.duckdns.org" in the IP address field, and then using whatever port number was displayed under the "IPv4 port" term in your server panel.
                On top of that, you can also run commands remotely from the server panel. This requires that you obviously have correct syntax - and don't use a slash at the start of your command!
                (unlike what you would do in game, putting a slash in front of the command invalidates it due to development choices regarding the official minecraft server software)
		If you're interested in the actual setup for all the server types:
                </p>
		<h2>Bedrock Server Setup</h2>
		<p class="doc-t">
		All Bedrock server setups rely on the official, vanilla dedicated server software created by Mojang.
		It's limited to 10 players only, with cheats disabled by default. You'll need to used the "Toggle Cheats" option to change that.
		</p>
		<h2>Java Server Setup</h2>
		<p class="doc-t">
		All Java server setups rely on the official vanilla dedicated server software created by Mojang.
		Java servers are limited to 20 players. Cheats are again disabled by default and need to be toggled manually.
		</p>
		<h2>Bedrock & Java Server Setup</h2>
		<p class="doc-t">
		All hybrid server setups rely on the Java dedicated server software developed by Mojang.
		However, thhere is an extra program added on top of it, called the standalone Geyser plugin.
		This runs along with the Java server to allow for both Bedrock and Java users to play.
		There are some downsides for Bedrock users though - they may experience more problems with movement.
		On top of that - Bedrock players require a Java edition account to access the server. (floodgate is not installed)
		Similar to Java servers, they are limited to 20 players and cheats need to be toggled manually.

		All servers are set to Survival by default.
		</p>
