		<h1>ABOUT WLWCCS</h1>
                <p>
		WLWCCS Hosting is a simple-to-use, free Minecraft server hosting capable of freely letting you run your servers 24/7 with little downtime!<br>  
                While you can still turn on and turn off your WLWCCS servers, if you wish for that 24/7 functionality - just leave it on! Even if there is no longer actually on the server, it'll still continue to run!<br>
                As of right now - WLWCCS servers come in the form as either a Bedrock edition server, a Java edition server and a server that supports both editions using a plugin called Geyser.<br>
                Once you setup a server, you join by using the domain name "wlwccs.duckdns.org" in the IP address field, and then using whatever port number was displayed under the "IPv4 port" term in your server panel.<br>
                On top of that, you can also run commands remotely from the server panel. This requires that you obviously have correct syntax - and don't use a slash at the start of your command!<br>
                (unlike what you would do in game, putting a slash in front of the command invalidates it due to development choices regarding the official minecraft server software)<br>
                </p>
