		<h1>DOCS</h1>
		<h2 class="version-title">How to Setup a Server</h2>
		<p class="doc-t">
		You'll want to first make an account.
		In the menu-bar at the top of the page, you should see a button that says "Signup". Click on that and setup an account.
		<i>NOTE: You must be at least 13 years old to make a WLWCCS account. You may read the <a href="policy.html">privacy policy</a> if you have any questions regarding this.</i>
		Now, once the signup process finishes successfully you will be taken to a screen where it'll ask you to choose between three differents options:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A bedrock server</li>
			<li>A java server</li>
			<li>A bedrock & java server</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="doc-t">
		Now, which one you choose heavily depends on what you want out of the server.
		If you are playing on Bedrock edition and the other players who will be on the server also use bedrock - choose the Bedrock option. 
		Bedrock servers are also generally smaller and faster than the other options.
		If you are playing on Java edition and the other players who will be on the server also use java - choose the Java option.
		If you have a mix of both edition players - use the Bedrock & Java option, which uses the standalone Geyser plugin. 
		There is the downside though that Bedrock players may experience some lag or weird movement bugs.

		Once you choose your option - you should then be taken to a server panel!
		
		When you make a server it is off by default. When you want to play on your server, press the "Toggle Server" option to turn it on and off when needed!
		Underneath you'll see the port number. This is crucial for when you actually want to join the server.

		When in Minecraft trying to add and play the server - set the IP address section to <b>wlwccs.duckdns.org</b> and set the port number to whatever you saw underneath the toggle button.
		
		If you want to do anything else:
		If you want to toggle cheats on the server - there's a button just for that in the server properties section of your server panel. By default, cheats are disabled.
		If you want to toggle the default gamemode on the server - there's a button for that in the server properties section of your panel. By default, the gamemode is Survival.
		There is also a field above the server properties section which is where you would input commands. Note that <b>most commands do not work without cheats enabled.</b>
		Note that also you must <b>drop the / at the start of the command like you would in Minecraft for the command to actually work.</b>
		</p>
		<h2 class="version-title">Repository Documentation</h2>
		<p class="doc-t">
		The WLWCCS website is completely open-source on GitHub. If you are interested in contributing to the repo, this is where you'll want to go for a guide.
		However, the actual backend isn't open-source due to keeping things secretive and also to minimize exploits.

		The main file is <code>client.js</code> as this is the file that is responsible for managing any communication from the website to the server I host.
		This includes configuring the servers, configuring server properties and managing accounts.
		The communcation is done over Secure WebSockets, and there are five specific structures the requests follow to portray ideas.

		The first one is called <b>Account Specific Requests.</b>
		These are structured as <code>X#Y</code>, where X is the type of request (e.g. NB to make a new bedrock server) and Y is the current account's ID.
		These require account ids as these requests apply to specific accounts.
		These are used for sending requests to specific Minecraft server containers, like toggling your server on and off.

		The second one is called <b>Error Check Requests.</b>
		These are structured as <code>XY</code>, where X is the type of request (e.g. S for the signup process) and Y is the error code (either 0 or 1).
		These do not require account ids as usually it's during these requests that the account ID of the client hasn't been determined yet.
		These are used throughout the signup or login process to determine if they were successful or not.
		Requests in this structure are always two characters long and are never sent from the client - these are always received from the server

		The third one is called <b>Triple Section Requests.</b>
		These are structured as <code>X#Y#Z</code>, where X is the type of request (e.g. G for server property toggles), Y is the property and Z is the account ID.
		These are similar to ASRs, as they apply to specific servers - hence requiring an account ID.
		These are used for server property toggles - such as changing the gamemode of a server from Survival to Creative.

		The fourth one is called <b>Identifier Determination Request.</b>
		These do look similar to ECRs but they are COMPLETE OPPOSITES.
		These are structured as <code>XY</code>, where X is a SHA256 key and Y is the type of management (either S or L).
		Unlike ECRs, these requests can only be sent by the client.
		These are used to signup and login.
		The SHA256 key is generated by what is put into the signup/login form, as X is the actual account data sent over.

		The fifth and last one is called <b>Account Specific Commands.</b>
		These are structured as <code>XY#Z</code>, where X is the type of request (e.g. C to run a command), Y is the command and Z is the account ID.
		Similar to ASRs and TSRs, these are account specific so they need account IDs.
		These are used for running commands in servers.

		Furthermore just talking about the project in general - it is a vanilla JS project. Exclusively HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
