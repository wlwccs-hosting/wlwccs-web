		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<h2 class="version-title">Q: What are the server limitations?</h2>
		<p class="doc-t">
		All servers can only hold a total of 10 players at once.
		There isn't nessecarily a limit to how much RAM or CPU percentage is dedicated to a server,
		but the amount of each spec a server receives is readjusted over time based on the overall status
		regarding the other servers currently running.
		</p>
		<h2 class="version-title">Q: What other limitations are there outside of the servers?</h2>
		<p class="doc-t">
		You can only have one server per account. And before you ask - <b><i>no</i></b>, it is not permitted to
		create alternative accounts to run multiple servers at once. 
		</p>
		<h2 class="version-title">Q: If WLWCCS is free - how do we make revenue?</h2>
		<p class="doc-t">
		WLWCCS Hosting will utilise ad revenue to make up for the free server hosting we provide.
		</p>
		<h2 class="version-title">Q: How do I actually access servers in Minecraft?</h2>
		<h3>Bedrock Edition</h3>
		<p class="doc-t">
		When you go into the servers section of Minecraft, scroll down and you should find a button that says "Add Server".
		Click on it, and you'll be prompted for the nickname you'll give the server and the server credentials.
		The port number is given on the server panel. The IP address is <i>wlwccs.duckdns.org</i>.
		Then you should be able to add the server and play on it.
		</p>
		<h3>Java Edition</h3>
		<p class="doc-t">
		Enter the Multiplayer section on the main menu and you'll find the "Add Server" option - similar to Bedrock.
		You will then be prompted with a server address field and a nickname field.
		The nickname field is up to you - this is completely cosmetic. This applies to Bedrock as well.
		The server address field requires you to write the IP address and port in the same field - split by a colon.
		This should be structured as "wlwccs.duckdns.org:<YOUR_PORT>". Obviously replace <YOUR_PORT> with the port on your panel.
		Press done and you should be able to access the server from there.
		</p>
		<h2 class="version-title">Q: I want to contribute to WLWCCS</h2>
		<p class="doc-t">
		A link to the GitHub repository is sourced on the landing page.
		If you want a good explanation on how the WLWCCS website works and communicates with the backend - read the documentation.
